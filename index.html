    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2> <p>
        Brandon Lee built the Luna app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Brandon Lee at no cost and is intended for use as is.
    </p> <p>
        This page is used to inform website visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and
        disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
    </p> <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p> <p>
        For a better experience, the app will record camera and microphone data, which is used for the purpose of recording video.
        
        Location permission is required for providing accurate route information during the recording of video. Location data is not accessed any time other than during the recording of video and is not used for any other purpose.
        Location data is encoded and stored locally on your device.
    
        The information gathered by the app is retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.
    </p> <p>The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.</p> <div><p>Link to privacy policy of third party service providers used by the app</p> <ul><li><a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">Google Play Services</a></li> <!----> <!----> <!----> <!----> <!----></ul> <ul><li><a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">Google Maps API</a></li> <!----> <!----> <!----> <!----> <!----></ul></div> <p><strong>Log Data</strong></p> <p>
